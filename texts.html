        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>A <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-persistent-identifier', 2)">persistent identifier</a></b> is a long-lasting reference to a resource.
            The <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-dataset', 2)">data(set)</a></b> you deposit in a
            <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-data-repository', 2)">data repository</a></b> should be assigned a globally unique, persistent and resolvable identifier (PID) so that
            both humans and machines can find it. Persistent identifiers are maintained and governed so that they remain
            stable and direct the users to the same relevant object consistently over time. Examples of PIDs include
            <a href="https://www.doi.org" target="_blank">Digital Object Identifier (DOI)<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>,
            <a href="https://www.handle.net" target="_blank">Handle<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, and
            <a href="https://arks.org" target="_blank">Archival Resource Key (ARK)<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>If your data(set) or metadata does not have a PID, you run the risk of
            "<b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-link-rot', 2)">link rot</a></b>" (also known as “link death”).
            When your data(set) or metadata is moved, updated to a new version, or deleted, older hyperlinks will no longer
            refer to an active page. Without a PID, others will not be able to find or reuse your data(set) or metadata
            in the long-term. </p>
        <h4>How to do this?</h4>
        <p>When you upload your data(set) or metadata to a data repository, the data repository (or other service providers)
            usually assigns a PID. Repositories ensure that the identifier continues to point to the same data or metadata,
            according to access terms and conditions you specified.</p>
        <p>There are many different types of PIDs, each with their own advantages, disadvantages, and disciplines they are
            typically used in. Generally speaking, the data repository will have thought about these aspects before deciding
            which PID type to use. In case you have to choose the PID type yourself, you can visit the
            <a href="http://www.pidforum.org/c/knowledge-hub/11" target="_blank">Knowledge Hub<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> on
            the PID Forum for guidance. Some disciplines or organisations also provide tools to help you make this choice, see for example this
            <a href="https://www.pidwijzer.nl/en/pid_results/new" target="_blank">Persistent Identifier Guide<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
            for cultural heritage researchers. Once you have chosen a PID type,
            you can search for data repositories providing that specific PID in registries such as
            <a href="https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&pidSystems%5B%5D=DOI" target="_blank">Re3data<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> or
            <a href="https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.hFLKCn" target="_blank">FAIRsharing (see related databases) <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
        <p>Not all data you produce during your research will need a PID. In general, those that underpin published findings
            or have longer term value are worth assigning a PID. If in doubt about which data should be allocated a PID,
            speak to your local research data management support team or the data repository.</p>

        <h4>Want to know more?</h4>
        <p>Did you know that a PID can refer to any kind of resource? Besides publications or datasets,
            a PID can also refer to, for example, a person, a scientific sample, a funding body, a set of geographical coordinates,
            an unpublished report, or a piece of software. Depending on what you find important to link to, you might want
            to consider using a PID for one or more of these resource types.</p>
        <p>Persistent identifiers may point to a data file, a web service response that contains data values, or ideally
            to an online page that contains metadata for context and the link to access the actual data or details about
            how to request access. The technical process of translating the identifier to a location is called ‘resolving’
            an identifier.</p>

        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p><b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-metadata', 2)">Metadata</a></b> is “data about data”,
            meaning that this type of data only contains information that describes
            or characterizes other data. There are different types of metadata that underlie different FAIR aspects.
            The focus of this question is on making sure your data(set) has a set of minimum descriptive information
            elements (also known as “discovery metadata”) to adequately communicate the content of your data(set) to others.</p>
        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>By providing the minimum descriptive information about your data(set), you will be assured that potential users,
            including those from other research domains, will be able to find and cite your data(set).</p>
        <p>It is worth spending time on providing a good description of your data(set). By sharing more details,
            you will make your data not just findable but also easier to understand for others. The more extensive, accurate,
            and clear the discovery metadata, the easier it is for potential reusers to determine whether or not they want
            to access your data(set).</p>
        <h4>How to do this?</h4>
        <p>When depositing your data(set), the data repository will show the metadata fields they support. The more fields
            you fill in, the easier it will be for others to find your data(set). You can use the following list as
            guidance on which minimum metadata elements to include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Descriptive information about the data(set) (e.g., creator, title, publisher,
                creation and publication date, summary and keywords describing the data).</li>
            <li>The unique, persistent, and resolvable identifier (PID) for the data(set).</li>
            <li>Data content (e.g., resource type, variable(s) measured or observed, method, data format and size)
                to accurately reflect the deposited data and increase its reusability.</li>
            <li>Access rights (e.g., information on how to request access in case the data(set) cannot be shared
                openly for ethical, legal, or commercial reasons). You should also include information about
                the rights holder and contact details here (see Q4).</li>
            <li>Meaningful and explicit links to other research outputs (e.g., prior versions of the data(set),
                other relevant data(sets), related publications, data source, relevant people (data creators or collectors),
                relevant organisations (the funder or host institution), ideally with their PIDs) to increase the
                interoperability and the potential for reuse of your data(set).</li>

        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>This question refers to the capability to make the metadata accessible online in a standard and machine-readable format.
            <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-machine-readable-format', 2)">Machine-readability</a></b> means that the data is presented
            in a structured <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-file-format', 2)">format</a></b> that computers can read and process.
            Facilitating this process is a responsibility of the data repository you deposit your data(set) in.</p>
        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>By ensuring that the metadata describing your data(set) is machine-readable, it will be findable to the systems that
            collect (also known as <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-harvesting', 2)">harvesting</a></b>) and
            aggregate data for search engines or databases (e.g., Google Search, Web of Science,
            or a university library collection). This improves your chances of having your data(set) cited and reused, because
            it will reach a larger audience. Without machine-readable metadata, your data(set) will only be found by people searching
            the data collection of the specific repository you deposited in or those that have a direct link to your data(set).</p>
        <h4>How to do this?</h4>
        <p>Most digital data repositories will have some kind of protocol for making metadata machine-readable. Two protocols
            that support FAIR (because they are open, free, and universally implementable) are
            <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/" target="_blank">OAI-PMH<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and
            <a href="https://restfulapi.net/" target="_blank">REST API<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
            Therefore, even though it is the responsibility of the data repository to carry out this task, it is your
            responsibility to select the right data repository to meet this requirement.  You can search for such a data
            repository on a registry such as
            <a href="https://www.re3data.org/search?query=" target="_blank">Re3data<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> by filtering on ‘API’.</p>

    <div id="F-i-3-additional">
        <h4>Want to know more?</h4>
        <p>Metadata may also be exposed as <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-structured-data', 2)">structured data</a></b>
            embedded within a webpage. This makes the metadata more <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-machine-actionable', 2)">machine-actionable</a></b>.
            The <a href="https://www.schema.org" target="_blank">Schema.org<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> standard is one approach that
            helps to ensure indexing by web search engines such as Google and Bing. This facilitates the
            <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com" target="_blank">Google Dataset Search<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
            which you can use to check if data hosted by the repository of your choice is indexed.</p>
        <p>If you are interested to understand more about how a machine reads a webpage, you can enable the developer view in your
            web browser (instructions vary between browsers) and take a look at a website.

<div id="A-i-1-contents">
    <div id="A-i-1-default">
        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>Ideally, data(sets) should be public domain and openly <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-access', 2)">accessible</a></b>
            without restrictions. However, there can be legitimate reasons not to share data (e.g., privacy protection, ethical,
            legal, or commercial constraints). As such, it is your responsibility to be aware of what can be shared, with whom
            and when, and to take appropriate steps to ensure that the data is as open as possible and as closed as necessary.</p>
        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>As explained in Q2, the metadata describing your data(set) should include details about who can access the data(set) as well
            as any possible related conditions that need to be met in order to gain access. By clearly specifying these details, you will
            be assured of the most appropriate access level to your data(set). A data(set) can have a public, embargoed, restricted, or
            closed access level. You can read more about access levels in the ‘What to know more?’ section.</p>
        <p>In some cases, you may even need to apply a variety of access levels to different parts of the same data(set). It is important
            to consider these issues early on for all your data(sets), so that the access levels are clearly defined before you upload
            the data(set) to a data repository. </p>
        <p>Data should also be accompanied by a clear <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-licence', 2)">licence</a></b> so that other
            people can legally reuse it. It is recommended to add a licence to all kinds of data(sets) and access levels. Without
            an explicit licence or a waiver, potential reusers do not have a clear sense of what can be done with your data.
            It is easiest to use a standard type license for your data(set), since there are many different types that will cover
            most basic legal situations
            (e.g., <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses" target="_blank">Creative Commons<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>).
            It is also possible to create your own bespoke licence, though it is recommended to seek help from a legal expert if you wish
            to pursue this. Your chosen licence should also be part of your (machine-readable) metadata to effectively inform any human or
            machine that comes across your data(set) about what they’re allowed to do with it.</p>
        <h4>How to do this?</h4>
        <p>You should determine the access level(s) and licence of your data(set) before depositing in a data repository. If you are not
            sure about the right access level or the licence for your data(set), check the institutional or funder policies or speak to
            your local research data management support team. Also be sure to choose a data repository that supports your desired access
            level and licence. You can search for such a data repository on a registry such as
            <a href="https://www.re3data.org/search?query=" target="_blank">Re3data<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>,
            by filtering on ‘Database access’ and ‘Database license’.</p>
        <p>If you are depositing data associated with a publication, it is recommended to include a
            <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-data-availability', 2)">data availability statement</a></b> in your publication.
            This statement communicates to readers of your publication where the data(set) is available and how it can be accessed.
            It also includes a link to the data(set). Most journals, especially those with a data sharing policy, will have templates for
            data availability statements available.</p>

        <h4>Want to know more?</h4>
        <p>Access levels can be categorised as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Public access</u> refers to data which everyone can access without any restrictions.</li>
            <li><u>Restricted access</u> refers to data that one can access under certain conditions
                (e.g. because of commercial, sensitive, or other confidentiality reasons or the data is only accessible
                via a subscription or a fee). Restricted data may be available to a particular group of users or after permission is granted.
                For restricted data, the metadata should include the conditions of access to the data
                (e.g., point of contact or instructions to access the data). In case you need to restrict access to your data(set),
                you should check if your data repository of choice supports access requests.</li>
            <li><u>Closed access</u> refers to data that is not made publicly available and for which only metadata is publicly available.</li>
            <li><u>Embargoed access</u> refers to data that will be made publicly accessible – either publicly or restricted –
                at a specific date which should be specified in the metadata. For example, a researcher may release their data after having
                published their findings from the data.</li>

        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>Even if a data(set) is no longer available, published references and links should always point to its metadata for
            transparency and integrity. In other words, this question is about whether the metadata will be preserved even
            when the data(set) it describes may no longer be available. </p>
        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>Even when your data(set) is not accessible, the metadata in itself can be very valuable for future reuse,
            especially when it is rich enough. Rich metadata means that it is elaborate enough to adequately inform someone
            with no prior knowledge about your data(set).  Keeping metadata accessible is a way to assure that your work can
            still be of use for future (replication) studies. If you want others to continue to discover and cite your work,
            it is essential to make sure the metadata describing your data(set) always remains available. As long as this is
            the case, links to your data(set) will not become invalid, but will simply point to the metadata only.</p>
        <h4>How to do this?</h4>
        <p>Whether or not a data repository provides continued access to metadata depends on the data repository preservation
            practices, which are usually documented in a <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-preservation-plan', 2)">preservation plan</a></b>
            or <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-preservation-plan', 2)">policy</a></b>.
            You should check whether the data repository you deposit your data(set) in has the policy to maintain metadata when data are removed.
            Make sure to include the persistent identifier in the remaining metadata and a statement on why this data(set) is no longer available.</p>

        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>There are many different ways you can describe the same information when filling out the metadata for your deposit.
            To prevent ambiguity and facilitate better findability, interoperability, and machine-readability,
            you should use a <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-controlled-vocabulary', 2)">controlled vocabulary</a></b> to enter your metadata.</p>
        <p>Controlled vocabularies are lists of terms that are created for specific uses or contexts. They are a type of
            <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-semantic-artefact', 2)">semantic artefact</a></b> and can take the form of, for example,
            an ontology, thesaurus, or taxonomy. Each type of vocabulary comes with a different degree of sophistication
            (e.g. in their level of expressiveness, structure, and inferential power).</p>
        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>When using controlled vocabularies, the discovery, linking, understanding, and reuse of research data are improved.
            Using controlled vocabularies in metadata facilitates enhanced data search because people will not have to guess
            the exact terms you used to describe your data(set) to find it. It also helps facilitate better interoperability
            of data from different sources, since it will be clear that data(sets) using the same terms cover the same information.</p>
        <p>Data repositories should provide support for the use of controlled vocabularies in metadata by offering relevant
            functionalities. They will often display which controlled vocabularies they support on their website.
            When controlled vocabularies are included in the metadata, your data repository of choice may be able to publish
            the metadata in machine-readable format, thus greatly increasing their machine actionability.</p>
        <h4>How to do this?</h4>
        <p>Controlled vocabularies are often domain-specific. It is recommended to use the vocabulary that is used most often
            in your field or specific line of research (see Q8). If you are unsure about this, you can contact your research
            support staff or look up some data(sets) from colleagues in your field.</p>
        <p>You can find data repositories supporting your preferred controlled vocabulary in registries such as
            <a href="https://fairsharing.org/standards" target="_blank">FAIRsharing<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> or

        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>Data <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-provenance', 2)">provenance</a></b> (also known as lineage) is a type of metadata
            that represents the history of your data(set), including information about the people, entities, and processes involved
            in the data creation. You can also describe and/or link previous versions of your data(set) in the provenance information.
            Aside from conveying important information about your data(set) to potential reusers, you can also communicate how you
            wish to be cited. </p>
        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>By providing provenance information about the data(set) (e.g. sources, date, contributor, version), you make it possible for users to
            determine whether to trust the authenticity of the data(set) and enable its (re)use. It is a transparent way to communicate why,
            how, when, where, and by whom your data(set) was created. </p>
        <h4>How to do this?</h4>
        <p>The provenance information that is necessary for your data(set) depends on the
            <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-data-type', 2)">data type</a></b> (e.g., measurement, observation, derived data,
            or data product) and research domain of your work. For that reason, it is difficult to capture a set of finite provenance records
            adequate to all domains. It is recommended to include at a minimum the following provenance properties of data generation or collection
            should be supplied as part of the metadata (this is not an exhaustive list):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sources of data generation or collection (e.g., model, instrument, methodology)</li>
            <li>The date of data creation or collection</li>
            <li>The contributor(s) involved</li>
            <li>Data versioning information (indicate relations to other versions and describe changes)</li>

    <div id="R-i-1-additional">
        <h4>Want to know more?</h4>
        <p>There are various ways in which provenance information may be included in a metadata record. Some of the provenance properties
            (e.g., instrument, contributor) may be best represented using persistent identifiers (such as
            <a href="https://www.doi.org" target="_blank">DOI<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> for data,
            <a href="https://orcid.org" target="_blank">ORCID<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> for researchers,
            <a href="https://www.grid.ac" target="_blank">GRID<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> for organisations).
            This way, humans and machines can retrieve more information about each of the properties by resolving the PID.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, the provenance information can be given a linked provenance record expressed explicitly using a controlled vocabulary
            (e.g., <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o" target="_blank">PROV-O<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>,
            <a href="https://pav-ontology.github.io/pav" target="_blank">PAV<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>,

    <div id="R-i-2-default">
         <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p>To ensure that your metadata can be broadly shared and understood within your research domain, we recommend using a
            <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-standard', 2)">community-endorsed standard</a></b>.
            A standard is any semantic artefact (see Q6), format (see Q3) or other information
            structure that is widely used in a specific group. If there are any agreements on best practices or standards
            in your community, you should always give preference to this option.</p>
        <p>Community standards may be formally recognized or less formal in their occurrence, but they will always be used and
            endorsed by the majority of the given community. What “community” means in this context can vary. It is highly
            recommended to follow domain- or discipline-specific standards, but there are also general purpose standards and
            smaller scale standards for sub-disciplines or organisations.</p>
        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>The main purpose of a community standard is to prevent misunderstandings due to ambiguity by making sure everyone
            is speaking the same language. By following the specifications of a community-endorsed standard for your metadata,
            you make sure that others can clearly understand and (re)use your data. It is easier to understand and reuse data
            that is similar to your own or that of others in the same field. Moreover, using a clearly defined structure and
            wording in your metadata can facilitate replication studies or meta-analyses.</p>
        <h4>How to do this?</h4>
        <p>You can use metadata registries such as the
            <a href="https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/" target="_blank">RDA<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
            or <a href="https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata" target="_blank">DCC<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
            to find more information on community-endorsed standards. For example, some well-established metadata standards are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://dublincore.org/resources/metadata-basics/" target="_blank">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>

                : A data format standard specifically for x-ray, neutron, and muon science.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A domain- or discipline-specific data repository should be your preferred choice for depositing your data(set).
            Such a repository will support a metadata standard for your relevant community. You can search for a suitable
            data repository by using Re3data and browsing on
            <a href="https://www.re3data.org/browse/by-subject" target="_blank">domain or subject<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
        <p>In case your domain has limited standards or standards that are still under development, you should follow general purpose standards.
            In case no dedicated data repositories are available for your domain (yet), we recommend contacting a research data management
            expert in your area to identify possible solutions.</p>

            This tool can transform your Dublin Core metadata into a machine-readable format.</p>
        <p>Many standards undergo continuous evaluation and development. The community-endorsed standards aim to be relevant for the users in
            the community which is why many of the organisations and initiatives that develop and maintain these standards seek community feedback.

        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <p><b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-file-format', 2)">File formats</a></b> refer to methods for encoding digital information.
            You can recognize a file format by the extension (the three or four letters at the end of a filename). A file can either be
            <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-file-format', 2)">open</a></b> or
            <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-file-format', 2)">proprietary</a></b> in its format.
            It is highly recommended to use an open file format for your data(set), so that others can easily access and reuse it.</p>
        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>A proprietary file format is created and owned by a company and often accompanies a specific software. This means that
            people who don’t have a licence for this software will not be able to open your file(s). Moreover, the developments and
            updates such a file format may undergo are dependent on the owner of the company, therefore it may be that older versions
            of the file format will not be supported in the future, or that the file format will cease to exist entirely.
            This doesn’t facilitate <b><a onclick="show_modal('glossary-long-term-preservation', 2)">long-term preservation</a></b>,
            as people may not be able to open your file(s) in the future.</p>
        <p>Open file formats are publicly accessible and often undergo less changes over time. They can be opened by anyone without
            the necessity of a license, which means your data(set) can be used more widely.</p>
        <h4>How to do this?</h4>
        <p>Data should be made available in a recommended file format that is accepted by the research community to enable data sharing,
            interoperability, and reuse. It is also important that the file format is supported by the data repository to enable
            long-term preservation. Repositories usually display an overview of their supported or preferred ( and sometimes also non-preferred)
            file formats on their website, and will generally have a couple of different options per data type (see for example the
            <a href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/recommended-formats" target="_blank">UK Data Service<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> or
            <a href="https://dans.knaw.nl/en/file-formats" target="_blank">DANS<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>).
            If you deposit your data in such a file format, the repository should have
            the necessary information, procedures, and expert knowledge to migrate your file(s) to a new one once it becomes outdated.</p>
        <p>If there is no open file format available for your data type, you may use a proprietary format. Try to find formats that are
            widely used and well-established, as the chances of those formats becoming obsolete are much smaller.</p>

        <p>The choice you make for short-term data processing may differ from the choices you make for long-term data preservation.
            During your research, you may want to adhere to the proprietary file formats that suit your chosen software or measurement instrument.
            To meet this FAIR requirement, you should convert your file(s) before depositing in a data repository. The software will
            often have some options built-in for this. During this process, it is important to be mindful of the risk of data loss during
            conversion. If you are unsure about which file format to convert your data to or how to do it, you should consult your data

        <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
        <p>Data curation and digital preservation requires people, skills, and technology. All the steps you take towards making your data(set)
            FAIR and of good quality contribute to the data curation process. You should be aware of the role a data repository plays in

            on ‘certificates’, or on the website of the certificate organisation.</p>
        <p>To make sure your data(set) can become as FAIR as possible and receive the best care over time, you should plan sufficient financial
            and/or human resources in your research project early in advance. This should include the costs of data stewardship throughout

            Technology (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0486-7" target="_blank">TRUST<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>).
            Certification requirements are based on these principles, to make sure certification is an indication of trustworthiness.</p>
        <p>In the absence of formal certification, a data repository can still be FAIR-enabling by facilitating some of the important qualities mentioned
            in the FAIR and TRUST principles. However, this is more difficult to discover on the outside. Other organisations, including funders or publishers,
            can also enable or support FAIRness by upholding requirements for data management or FAIR practices (e.g., mandating Data Management Plans),
            these organisations contribute to a more FAIR scientific landscape.</p>
